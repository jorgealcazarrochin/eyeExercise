# eyeExercise
##In this exercise, we create an interactive web page with a visual element that tracks the user's mouse movement. Specifically, it is a representation of a pair of eyes that move according to the position of the mouse cursor on the screen. When we move the mouse, the program captures the mouse events and adjusts the position of the eyes so that they appear to be following the movement of the cursor in real time.

#How to run
